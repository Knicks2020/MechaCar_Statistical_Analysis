## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Deliverable 1. 
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

  "In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each 
 coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model".  Based on our calculations it does not appear that the vehicle length & the ground clearance are completely random.  They both appear to have an impact on the miles per gallon of each car.  The intercept is statistically significant so the slope is not considereed to be zero. Also, after viewing the multiple R-Squared value we see that it is greater that 7 so I believe that it predicts the mpg of each vehicle effectively.
