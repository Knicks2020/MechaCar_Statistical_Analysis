## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

  "In the summary output, each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each 
 coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model".  Based on our calculations it does not appear that the vehicle length & the ground clearance are completely random.  They appear to have an impact on the miles per gallon of each car.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?


* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
